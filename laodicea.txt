-Tower of the Gods
	A glittering art deco skyscraper, the Tower soars above its surroundings. At its peak, four gilded statues face the four corners of the Calundria. These four statues represent the four gods of Laodicea: Peace, Knowledge, Freedom, and Expansion. A seat of democracy, Laodicea naturally venerates these four ideals above all else.
