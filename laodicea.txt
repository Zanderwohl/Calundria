-Tower of the Gods
	A glittering art deco skyscraper, the Tower soars above its surroundings. At its peak, four gilded statues face the four corners of the Calundria. These four statues represent the four gods of Laodicea: Peace, Knowledge, Freedom, and Expansion. A seat of democracy, Laodicea naturally venerates these four ideals above all else.
		From the top of the tower runs a great thick cable into the evening mist. This is the western terminal of the Transoceaninc Arial Cable Railway, an enormous suspended-cable railway that spans the ocean from Wynnewood.
