Eurydine Iskonthanad 
backstory here:

Eurydine grew up in a noble family that was successful and flourishing. While her parents (Hayde and Percy) were sometimes absent, they made sure that all her wants and needs were taken care of. As long as she was the perfect noble daughter, that is. Most people would be okay with this deal, Eurydine was spoiled from the day she was borne and was dissatisfied with the limited freedom she had. When her family announced that she was going to enter society at the age of 16, she decided to make her own way, taking her jewlery and allowance and sneaking out of the mansion in the night. While her parents frantically looked for her, she had quickly blown through her money on women and other such pleasures (including the many fines she received for breaking the law near continuously) and was forced to get a job where she could. One of her one/off girlfriends got her a position as an acrobat/entertainer. She enjoyed this work quite a lot, even more so when she was inducted into the acrobats (read: thieves) guild, where she was able to fund her lifestyle/thirst for excitement. She became known this way and while her parents did find her, her criminal record/total disregard for their wants caused them to disown her, and are now sending people after her to get her to stay out of the gossip rags (though not kill her). Annoyed with the hassle she brought with her, the circus kicked her out, and she's been wondering around for a job since.
