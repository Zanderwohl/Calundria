Occupation: Guild Artisan – Jeweler

Background:
The only child to a single mother (Alirah Kanan), she grew up in Laodicea.
She grew up fascinated by shiny things, and eventually became a jeweler and lens-crafter, studying the manipulation of light and magic. Her mother, a member of the city’s {Jewler's Row}, helped her establish herself as an artisan with great promise. She started her own running her own specialty shop selling cut jewels, fine glass-work, and minor magic items. However, despite technical talent, she was only moderately successful as a business woman due to her refusal to curry favor with her richer clients and her reputation for creating volatile inventions.

After a spat with GLENN DIXON regarding the safety of her business, the legal fees imposed by the city became prohibitively expensive, and she was forced to close her shop. With her mother comfortably in retirement, she decided to go adventuring to gather new ideas – and to field test her inventions in a way she had never been able to in the city.

Foe: Glenn Dixon
	City Magic Inspector (for Laodicea)
