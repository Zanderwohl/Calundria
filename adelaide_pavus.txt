So basically my character is an inventor mage.  She was in her brother's shadow, her brother being one of the most famous inventors of all time. He was a household name, known for inventing something that is in everyone's home (telephone, television, or something) and a form of public transport (train, blimp, etc.). He had announced that his next big invention would be a computational device run by a combination of steam and magic. Unbeknownst to the world, he did not posses the magical ability to pull it off. All of the magical ability in the family had passed to his sister. The invention had been her idea and he had stolen it. During a heated argument between the two, she let her anger get the best of her and lost control of her magic, killing him. While she was able to make it look like an accident and shift suspicion away from herself, she vowed to spend the rest of her life making up for it. She put her work of the computational device on hold and poured the family fortune into philanthropy. Countless orphanages and soup kitchens soon bore her name. Inspired by the work of Karl Marx, she began organising unions and sponsoring strikes. Burdened by the guilt of killing her brother, she begins experimenting with necromancy, hoping to bring him back into the land of the living.
