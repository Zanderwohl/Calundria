Session 2 Headlines (December 9th):
	Kensington, Wynnewood was attacked by what onlookers describe as a 'mechanized tornado' - the whirling machine tunneled into the Kensington Power Substation and unearthed the power shards, stripping them from their housings and making off in mere moments. The city has been left without power since. Authorities are trying to determine the origins and destination of this tremendous machine - locals have produced several photographs, none of which have shed light on the situation. Investigation is ongoing.
	
	The Royal Research Fleet has reported the disappearance of their flagship RRS Ubiquity - the ship has seemingly disappeared from the surface of the ocean. The ship was last seen heading toward No Man's Land, with a final transmission around 1800 hours on December 6th. The Sutt claim the Ubiquity's heading would have placed it in violation of the treaty between Sutton, Wynnewood, and Midea, but have been unable to produce proof that the ship crossed into No Man's Land. The RSS Heavenreich has been dispatched to search for signs of wreckage, or hopefully make contact with the missing ship.
	
	A series of break-ins was committed on Beech St. last night. Shopkeepers found little missing, though one shopkeep found his entire inventory of purses ruined by mud. "I just don't know why anyone would do this," he commented, "if it's protest I don't understand what it means."
	
	Opinion: With the rapid expansion of the transcontinental railroad, ticket prices have become unreasonable. While we can all agree the railroad is the most convenient method of inter-city travel, railroads have been all too eager to expand into new territory. Besides the danger from thieves and savages, the largest downside is the increased ticket cost for well-behaved citizens who rarely travel through dangerous country...

Session 3 Headlines (December 10th):
	Robot Attack! Yesterday evening, hundreds of flying mechanical men descended upon Laodicea, unearthing the many power stations distributed throughout the city. The robots made off with thousands of shards, leaving much of the city without power. Security and police forces work on restoring order the the city.

Session 4 (December 11th):
	Lucia
		She sleeps sound most nights but losing her shop was pretty painful. I imagine sometimes she remembers late at night a time when she didn't have to worry about food, and she was working alongside Brenda before their shops closed. I think her nightmare would be working the shop late into the night and noticing that no one's there. She checks outside and the streetlights are on but no one's around. She check Brenda's room and it's empty, she looks back at her tools and the workbech is clean, but bare. Like she never had started a shop in the first place.
